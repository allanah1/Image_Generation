# Image_Generation
Images were generated using 2 different methods. The results of GAN are much sharper than those of VAE. That is, the generated images. 
The pictures from GAN are much crisper whereas those from VAE appear blurred with noise or distorted. 
However, VAE converges much faster than the GAN. Perhaps this is due to the somewhat ’battle’ between the generator and discriminator of the GAN.
